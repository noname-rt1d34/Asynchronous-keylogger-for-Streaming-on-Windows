KeyTracker.exe [twitchname] TslGame.exe HaloInfinite.exe AoE2DE_s.exe

TslGame.exe is pubg

Tool will auto-close if there is no twitch handle passed in, because I was lazy and didn't do a case where it checks if it is missing

If someone wants it to do more, I can do it, message me on twitch :D https://www.twitch.tv/noname_rt1d34

This is my first github I've ever made too

Hash's of KeyTracker.exe (I don't know if this will help cause the only way the exe can be replaced is if a hacker has access to this account.... And can just as easily modify this info anyway...?):
